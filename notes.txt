Stream Library
	- URI
		- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier
		- Mostly used to identify endpoints, used later for message topic paths
		
	-Stream
		- Represents sequence of bytes (string) that can be traversed
		- Base class for all mechanisms that read/write data to medium (memory, file, network, etc.)
		- Includes concrete implementations for StringStream (memory buffer) and FileStream
		
	- Endpoint
		- Can connect to another endpoint (client) or be connected to (server)
	
	- Connection
		- Represents single communication channel
		- Spawned by server or created directly
		- Provides implementation of connection state events
		- Provides Stream instance for outside code to use (Concrete stream instance created by child)
		
TCP Library
	-TCPStream
		- Provides implementation to get data in/out of a tcp connection
		
	-TCPServer
		- Manages TCP listener, spawns TCPClient for connections
		
	-TCPClient
		- Manages tcp connection and triggers connection events
		- Creates TCPStream instance for outside access to data
